## Exchange Rate Inefficiencies
 This is a small project to find inefficiencies in forex and provide advice on taking advantage of them. Ie it tests the exchange rates of multiple currencies and if there is a more efficient way, ie one that makes you money, suggests that

## Problem statement
Let's say the exchange rate of A to B is slightly bigger than the inverse of B to A, such that in making the exchange you can make a small gain. The gain has to also be big enough to make it worthwhile especially considering comissions in the real life scenario. To make things a bit more complicated it is possible that the biggest discrepancy in exchanging from A to B can be found through C, meaning that A to C to B is much bigger than B to A (or B to C to A). 
Making things even more complicated is the fact that we are not constraint to any starting
